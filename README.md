# **YouTube Playlist Creator CLI**

A simple and powerful command-line tool to create a YouTube playlist directly from a text file of songs.

This tool securely authenticates with your own Google Account using OAuth 2.0, searches for each song from your list, and adds the top result automatically to a new playlist.

## **Features**

* **Create** Playlists from a **File**: Instantly turn a simple text file of songs into a YouTube playlist.  
* **YouTube & YouTube Music**: Choose whether to create a standard video playlist or a playlist specifically for YouTube Music.  
* **Secure Authentication**: Uses the official Google OAuth 2.0 flow. Your credentials are stored locally and are never shared.  
* **Customizable**: Set the title, description, and privacy status (public, private, or unlisted) for your new playlist.  
* **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
